# PaperScripts overview
This repository contains scripts written to produce a number of research articles, which are shared to enhance reproducibility in research. Whenever possible, data are also included in the repository.


PaperScripts includes the following projects:
* [`sc_unireadout`](http://github.com/fragrussu/PaperScripts/tree/master/sc_unireadout): code and simulated data part of "Multi-parametric quantitative spinal cord MRI with unified signal readout and image denoising". Grussu F, Battiston M, Veraart J, Schneider T, Cohen-Adad J, Shepherd TM, Alexander DC, Novikov DS, Fieremans E, Gandini Wheeler-Kingshott CAM; biorxiv 2019 (DOI: 10.1101/859538).
